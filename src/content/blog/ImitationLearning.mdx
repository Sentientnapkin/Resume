### What am I doing here?

Well frankly for me I found myself taking an interest in the robotics world more and more. 

I found myself kind of trapped in the SWE life once I got a solid internship offere and I felt like I wanted to try more things and do really technically difficult things as best as I could.

And so I looked at the LeRobot repository and found the cheapest option that I had available to me and I decided on the SO-101 Robot.

While it came in (and of course at first I messed up and only ordered the electronics) I decided to start reading through what the world of robotics was looking like through research papers. 

I started off with AUTOLab at Berkeley, and as I went through and saw really cool articles on RoboDM and really impressive technical articles, of course the one that stood out to me was a discussion from a conference that they documented on the future on robotics.

The split was between the world of imitation learning/machine learning methods vs. using kinematics solutions to solve robotics problems. 

Obviously both sides made compelling points, but I was woefully unfamiliar with the world of imitation learning and robotics (except for apparently this [car I made](https://x.com/luxonis/status/1555234539831644160?s=20) in the summer after 10th grade of high school) so I wanted to try it out!

I also ended up reading through a lot of what [Physical Intelligence](https://www.pi.website/) and my oh my is that research amazing, and I wanted to see what a small scale version of that would look like.

So, I'm going to start figuring out how all of this works in the hopes of making something cool!

### My robot arrives...

My robot also came as I was making this! And I have fully assembled it and it's been set up and ready to get going! I will give more updates as I go through the proccess of working with this arm!
